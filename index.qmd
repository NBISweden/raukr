In Life Sciences and Bioinformatics, the R programming language is pivotal for data transformation, statistical analyses, and crafting publication-ready visualizations. This workshop goes beyond the basics, offering participants a comprehensive understanding of the R ecosystem. We explore best coding practices, code profiling, data wrangling, generating reports from notebooks and development of web apps using R.
